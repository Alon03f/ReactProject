## About Me
My name is Alon Friedman, a web development student. From a young age I was interested in technology,
design and programming, and today I invest my time in learning and developing projects that combine clean design with a quality user experience.
Beyond the basics of website building, I like to incorporate creativity into every project.
That I approach â€“ whether it is through choosing colors, arranging elements, or building a convenient, accessible and user-friendly interface.
This site was built from scratch and reflects my current abilities. Currently I am still studying for a FullStack professional degree, I aim high and look forward to the future in the field.
